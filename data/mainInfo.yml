"Awesome image!": >
  Curated overview of awesome Javascript projects 
  to read / write / convert / compress / process 
  images of different formats.

"Columns' definitions":
  - N: "Name of the module"
  - R: "Reading formats"
  - W: "Writing formats"
  - Code: "Is the module's source code open or closed"
  - Modular: "Is it modular or integrated GUI"
  - I: 
      - Pure - Written completely in JavaScript
      - Native Binding -  wrapper library that bridges two programming languages. It provides glue code specifically made to allow JavaScript to use a foreign code written in C, C++, etc.
      - CUI adapter - wrapper library that transformes JS instructions into shell commands of another library or framework (typically written in a lower level code)
  - PL: "Programming language in which module is written"
  - B.s: "Does the module support the browser"
  - N.s: "Does the module support Node.js"
  - Deps: "The amount of dependents of this module"

"Sorting Algorithm (descending order significance)": 
  - Sort by Code (Open > Closed)
  - Sort by the sum of reading and writing formats (For the table "Modules to read/write/convert/compress images") or sum of B.s and N.S (For the table "Modules to process images")
  - Sort by the amount of dependents
