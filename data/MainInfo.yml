"Awesome image!": >
  Curated overview of awesome Javascript projects 
  to read / write / convert / compress / process 
  images of different formats.

"Columns' definitions":
  - Name: "Name of the project"
  - R: "Reading formats"
  - W: "Writing formats"
  - Code: "Is the project's source code open or closed"
  - Modular: "Is it modular (extendable entity) or integrated GUI (enclosed system provided as is)"
  - Interface: 
      - Pure - Written completely in JavaScript
      - Native Binding -  wrapper library that bridges two programming languages. It provides glue code specifically made to allow JavaScript to use a foreign code written in C, C++, etc.
      - CUI adapter - wrapper library that transformes JS instructions into shell commands of another library or framework (typically written in a lower level code)
  - Language: "Programming language in which project is written"
  - B.s: "Does the project support the browser"
  - N.s: "Does the project support Node.js"
  - Deps: "The amount of dependents of this project"
  - Working: "Does this project works out of the box(Working) or require additional settings(Broken)"

"Sorting Algorithm (descending order significance)": 
  - Sort by Working (Working > Broken)
  - Sort by Code (Open > Closed)
  - Sort by the amount of Read or Write formats (For the tables "Project to read images" or "Project to write images" respectively) or by the sum of reading and writing formats (For the tables "Projects to convert images" and "Projects to compress images") or by the sum of B.s and N.S (For the table "Projects to process images")
  - Sort by the amount of dependents
